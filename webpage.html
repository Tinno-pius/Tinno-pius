<p id="tbn1"><img src="file:///C:/Users/USER/OneDrive/Imagens/image_3.jpg" width="400" height="300" style="float: left;">A forest is a large area dominated by trees, forming a complex ecosystem vital for biodiversity, climate regulation, and providing resources like clean air, water, and food,<br>
     housing over half of the world's land species and supporting livelihoods for billions, though facing threats like deforestation for agriculture.<br>Biodiversity Hotspots: Home to 80% of land-based species (plants, animals, insects).
Climate Regulators: Absorb pollutants, produce oxygen, store massive amounts of carbon, and help mitigate climate change.
Water Cycle: Act as giant water filters, feeding rivers and supplying cities with drinking water.
Resources: Provide timber, fuel, food, and livelihoods for millions.
Structure: Layers include the canopy (top), understory (middle), and forest floor (ground). 
Types of Forests
Deciduous: Trees lose leaves seasonally (e.g., temperate forests).
Coniferous (Evergreen): Trees stay green year-round (e.g., boreal forests).
Rainforests: Extremely biodiverse, with complex canopy structures. 
Threats & Management
Deforestation: Primarily driven by agriculture (soy, palm oil, cattle).
Sustainable Management: Organizations like the FSC promote certified sustainable forestry. 
Modern Usage
Productivity Apps: "Forest" is also the name of an app that helps users focus by growing virtual trees. 
    Forests have distinct layers (canopy, understory, floor) and types (deciduous, coniferous, rainforests) and play crucial roles in filtering water, storing carbon, and buffering storms. <br></p><br>

    dictating how data flows and impacting performance, scalability, and reliability; common types include Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, Tree, and Hybrid, each offering different benefits for connectivity and management.<br>
     They define both the layout (physical) and data paths (logical), acting as a blueprint for network structure.Common Network Topologies
Star: All devices connect to a central hub or switch, making it easy to add/remove nodes but vulnerable if the central point fails.
Bus: All devices connect to a single backbone cable; simple and cheap, but performance degrades with traffic, and a break in the cable stops the network.
Ring: Devices form a closed loop, with data passing from one device to the next; offers balanced performance but a single break can disrupt the whole ring.
Mesh: Devices have multiple, redundant connections, offering high reliability (fault tolerance) but complex and costly to implement.
Tree (Hierarchical): A combination of star and bus, with central nodes branching out; good for scalability, often used in larger enterprise networks.
Hybrid: Combines two or more different topologies (e.g., a Star-Bus), leveraging strengths of multiple structures. 
Physical vs. Logical Topology
Physical: The actual layout of cables and devices (e.g., wires in a building).
Logical: The path data takes across the network, which can differ from the physical setup (e.g., Token Ring's logical ring on a physical star). 
Why Topology Matters
Performance: Affects data transmission speeds and congestion.
Scalability: How easily the network can grow.
Reliability/Fault Tolerance: How well it handles failures.
Cost: Influences hardware and cabling expenses.
Troubleshooting: Simplifies finding and fixing network issues.  </p><hr>
